# Link Shortener

Solventum Code Challenge.

## Requirements
- Java 17+
- Maven 3.6+

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install

Stack Required:
- Java 
- Spring

Stack that I want to use:
- Java
- Spring Boot
- React for front-end
- NPM to connect front-end and back-end
- Maven for running the project
- Vercel for deployment
- Hopefully I can use one of my parked domains for this

ToDo:

☐ React Front-End </br>
☑️ Spring Boot </br>
☐ NPM connection to back-end (or a better way) </br>
☐ Tests </br>
